There is something really special about this corner of Eastern California. The Owens Valley is in proximity of many extreme landmarks. You can visit <a href="/places/death-valley/">the lowest point in North America</a> or the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BGLAV4fKv-f/">tallest peak in the lower 48</a> all within a day. Add to that a grove of what is believed to be some of the oldest trees in the world. That is the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/specialplaces/?cid=stelprdb5129900">Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest just outside of Bishop, Ca</a>.

A short drive off Highway 395 up into the White Mountains will take you to the Schulman Grove Visitor Center. From here, you can hike the short 1 mile Discovery Trail. This will get you up close with the ancient trees that date to over 4,000 years old. Past the visitor’s center, the road looses it’s pavement. If you are willing to keep driving, there is also the Patriarch Grove of the bristlecone pines.
