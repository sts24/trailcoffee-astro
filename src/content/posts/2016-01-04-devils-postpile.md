Hidden away outside the bustle of the Mammoth ski resort lies <a href="http://www.nps.gov/depo/index.htm">Devil's Postpone National Monument</a>. This relatively moderate hike through the forested woodland of Red's Meadow Valley leads to a massive geological formation called Devil's Postpile. This was once a lava flow that cooled down into many tall, hexagonal tubes of basalt rock. A short hike to the top of the formation will give you a closeup view of this cooled lava flow.

Access to the National Monument is only available via shuttle bus from the Mammoth ski resort lodge, and also serves as a major jumping off point for Pacific Crest Trail and John Muir Trail Hikers. The Red's Meadow area also offers many other hiking trails and camping as well as a backcountry store. The road to drop off area also offers a great view of the surrounding Sierra peaks at Minaret Vista.
