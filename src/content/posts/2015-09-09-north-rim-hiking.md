While many visitors to Grand Canyon National Park will flock to the more accessible South Rim with itâ€™s abundance of amenities, there is another side to the park that offers a completely different experience. The North Rim sits at a higher elevation than the South Rim and is home to a coniferous forest, cooler temperatures, and the famous beefalo herds. Since it is a bit of drive from other major cities, there are much fewer crowds, which is another contrast to the opposite side. Driving east from the main visitor area of the North Rim, you have access to places like Point Imperial, Cape Final, and Cape Royal. Each offer a range of hikes and overlooks of the eastern section of the Grand Canyon.
