When you have yourself a unique rock formation in the greater Los Angeles region, there’s a good chance it has been used as a backdrop for a Hollywood production. <a href="http://parks.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/dpr/Parks/Vasquez_Rocks_Natural_Area">Vasquez Rocks, just outside Santa Clarita</a>, has been used numerous times over the years for TV and film. Most famously, the rocks have served as a setting for <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Vasquez_Rocks">many alien planets in the Star Trek franchise</a>.

Due to it’s Hollywood fame, it is a popular area for visitors, even for those who aren’t hiking. There are a handful of trails to explore including the Pacific Crest Trail, although nothing too strenuous or lengthy.
