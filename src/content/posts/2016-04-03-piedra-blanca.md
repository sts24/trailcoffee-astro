The Piedra Blanca (or “white rocks” in Spanish) are large rock formation tucked away in the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lpnf/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=11058&amp;actid=50">Sespe Wilderness of the Los Padres National Forest</a>. This is about a 40 minute drive north of Ojai, Ca up the Highway 33. This is a twisty and scenic drive that is worth taking just for the great views you will see along the way. The further you go up the road, the more remote it feels. Once you get to the trailhead, it feels like a different world from where you left in Ojai or Ventura area.

The Piedra Blanca trailhead offers a starting point to venturing deeper into the wilderness area along the Sespe Creek. The hike over to the big rocks is relatively short , but worth checking out.
