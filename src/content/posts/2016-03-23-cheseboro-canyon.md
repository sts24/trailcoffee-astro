Hidden away in the hills off the 101 freeway between Agoura Hills and Calabasas is <a href="http://www.nps.gov/samo/planyourvisit/cheeseboropalocomado.htm">Cheseboro Canyon</a>. This beautiful oak woodland is under the purview of the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area and is popular for hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. The entire system of trails that meander up and around the canyon hillsides offer a variety of options for experienced and inexperienced hikers alike. The main trail in the canyon floor stays mostly flat, while the canyon sides give you great views of this area of the Conejo Valley.

For a bonus, see if you can find the Ventura/Los Angeles County line marker on the western canyon hillside. Also, if you are feeling adventurous, this trail will link up with the <a href="/china-flat-in-simi-valley/">Simi Peak/China Flat area to the north.</a>
