Sitting above the community of Claremont, Ca is the 5,700 foot summit of Sunset Peak. From a distance, it is recognizable by itâ€™s many radio antenna sitting near the top. The nearly 8 mile hike to the peak is fairly accessible to those of many levels of experience as the trail follows along a well maintained dirt road. Make the drive out of Baldy Village up Glendora Ridge Road to a wide spot in the road where the dirt road starts.
