The <a href="http://www.ci.claremont.ca.us/government/departments-divisions/human-services/parks/claremont-hills-wilderness-park-chwp/history-of-claremont-hills-wilderness-park">Claremont Wilderness Park</a> was one of my earliest experiences hiking as a kid. The park offers easy access to the surrounding community to experience the oak woodland of Cobal Canyon and the sweeping views of the Inland Empire from Burbank Canyon. The trail itself is a 5 mile loop that climbs up to the top of the ridge between the two canyons. At roughly the two mile mark lies a connection to another trail to take you to the top of nearby Potato Mountain. The half mark has a small rest area with a great view of the area. Parking at the trailhead costs $5 at the time of this writing, and it can fill up fast.
