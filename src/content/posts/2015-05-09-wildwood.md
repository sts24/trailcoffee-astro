The great thing about living where I do is incredible amount of open space set aside for outdoor recreation. Wildwood Park in Thousand Oaks is by far the most prominent of these open spaces. The area provides a variety of trails with many options based on how far you feel like going that day.

The highlight of the park is Paradise Falls. This is situated at the bottom of the canyon on the far end from the main parking lot.

The main loop I like to take is going downwards into the canyon first, to the waterfall, into the picnic area in Skunk Hollow, and back up to the main plateau on the Mesa Trail. If you are ready to go a little further, you may keep going from the picnic area past the water treatment plant and back up the long, steep climb to Lizard Rock.

Another option is to climb upwards from the Mesa Trail to the Santa Rosa Trail. At the top, you will be treated to wide views of the Conejo Valley, Oxnard Plain to the west, and the Ventura county mountains in the north.
