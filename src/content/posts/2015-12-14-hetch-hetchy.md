Hetch Hetchy is the man-made lake most famously known for being reservoir within Yosemite National Park. While we often think of our National Parks are these highly respected preservations of natural beauty, this has not always been the case historically. Once described by naturalists like John Muir as a valley equally worth the admiration as it’s neighboring Yosemite Valley, Hetch Hetchy was dammed up in the 1920s.

While we can’t enjoy the valley as it were in years past, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hetchhetchy.htm">there is a relatively accessible trail lining the northern end of the lake to Wapama Falls</a>. This five mile trail follows along the lake side and offers many great views deeper into the valley. This area of Yosemite National Park may not be on the top of the list for visitors, but it might be worth the visit for the historical importance.
